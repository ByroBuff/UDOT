# Introduction
Ultimate Discord Osint Tool (UDOT) is a tool that is meant to extract any and all information that can be 100% linked to a discord user. No information that is not directly a part of the users bio or connected accounts etc. is extrapolated. It uses a recursive method that finds even more accounts using a bio link for example
